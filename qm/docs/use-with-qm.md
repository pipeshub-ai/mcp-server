# Use PipesHub with QM

When this is done, anyone in your QM org can ask the agent about company
documents. Answers are limited to what that person's PipesHub account can
see.

If you **already run QM**, start at [Connect PipesHub](#connect-pipeshub).
Standing up QM is the long part. The integration itself is short.

This is not an MCP attachment. QM is an MCP *server* to its own harness; it
cannot add PipesHub as an MCP client. The integration is a `pipeshub` CLI
inside the agent sandbox.

Each person uses **their own** PipesHub personal access token. Never share one
token across the org.

## What you need

| You need | Why |
| --- | --- |
| A running PipesHub with indexed documents | That is what the agent searches |
| A **public HTTPS** URL for that PipesHub | Agent sandboxes run on Fly Sprites, not on your laptop. `localhost` is unreachable from them. A Cloudflare tunnel is enough for a trial |
| [Fly Sprites](https://fly.io/docs/sprites/) access (`sprite login`) | A Fly account alone is not enough. Sandboxes do not run locally |
| A model API key (Anthropic, OpenRouter, …) | QM calls a model every turn |
| Node **24+** and Docker | QM requires `engines.node` `>=24.0.0` |

You do not need bun, and you do not need to build the CLI from source.
Install `@pipeshub-ai/mcp@2.3.1` or later.

---

## 1. Stand up QM (skip if it already runs)

```bash
npx @yc-software/qm init ./qm-deploy --org yourorg --target docker
cd qm-deploy && npm install
```

`target: docker` runs QM's own services on your machine. **Agents still
execute on Sprites.**

Set the sandbox backend in **both** places in `qm.config.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"sandbox": { "backend": "sprites", "app": "your-sandboxes" },
"env": { "core": { "HARNESS": "pi", "SANDBOX_BACKEND": "sprites" } }
```

QM only loads `SPRITES_TOKEN` when `env.core.SANDBOX_BACKEND` is `"sprites"`.
If you set it only under `sandbox`, `qm check` still passes and core fails at
provision time. Confirm with `npx qm plan` — look for `.env keys not
forwarded to any container`.

```bash
npx qm setup .
npx qm check && npx qm doctor
npx qm up
```

`qm setup` writes empty placeholders for values you skip. If you later append
the real value, the key can appear twice. Search `.env` for duplicates before
debugging anything else.

The first `qm up` can take 10–40 minutes (large image pulls). When it finishes
it prints URLs.

---

## 2. Connect PipesHub

From the QM deployment directory:

```bash
npm install -g @pipeshub-ai/mcp
pipeshub init-qm .
```

That writes the tool, the skill, and a Dockerfile pinned to the same CLI
version. Re-running is safe: existing files are kept.

Set `egress` in `sandbox/tools/pipeshub/tool.json` to your PipesHub hostname
only — for example `pipeshub.your-company.com` or
`your-subdomain.trycloudflare.com`. No scheme, no path.

Then:

```bash
npx qm check && npx qm up
```

`qm sandbox publish` does **not** put `pipeshub` on PATH. On Sprites the
published image is ignored
([qm#272](https://github.com/yc-software/qm/issues/272)). The agent installs
the CLI on first use; that install persists on that Sprite.

---

## 3. Each person: PAT and keychain

In PipesHub: **Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Create**. Accept
the defaults. Keep the `phpat_` prefix if the token has one; it is for secret
scanners, not a second secret.

Do not add `semantic:read` if the agent asks for it — that scope is search
*history*, not search, and it is not on a stock instance. Search is
`semantic:write`, and the CLI already uses it.

In QM, add **two personal keychain credentials** (same form twice). Never paste
the token into chat.

| Service | Environment variable | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pipeshub` | `PIPESHUB_TOKEN` | The PAT only — no `KEY=`, no URL |
| `pipeshub` | `PIPESHUB_BASE_URL` | Public HTTPS origin, no `/mcp` path |

Service must be exactly `pipeshub`. The environment-variable field is marked
optional; fill it in. If you leave it blank on the token entry, QM derives
`PIPESHUB_TOKEN` from the service name. It will not derive `PIPESHUB_BASE_URL`.

Do **not** put the PAT in `sandbox.secretEnv` — that is org-wide and would
apply one person's permissions to everyone. Do **not** rely on `sandbox.env`
for the URL — it does not reach the sandbox
([qm#351](https://github.com/yc-software/qm/issues/351)). For a whole team,
the URL can instead be an org service credential (delivery `env`, key
`PIPESHUB_BASE_URL`).

The MCP paste block (`PIPESHUB_MCP_URL=` / `PIPESHUB_MCP_TOKEN=`) is for a
local MCP client, not for this keychain.

---

## 4. First message

In a new QM chat: “What do we know about X? Cite the document.”

If `pipeshub` is missing on that Sprite, the agent should run, **once**:

```bash
command -v pipeshub >/dev/null 2>&1 || npm install -g @pipeshub-ai/mcp
```

That install is unpinned on purpose. The Dockerfile pins an exact version for
when [qm#272](https://github.com/yc-software/qm/issues/272) is fixed and the
image actually boots. Until then this is the only install that runs, and
leaving it unpinned means a Sprite picks up patches without a skill edit.

Use the `pipeshub` CLI (`ask`, `search`, `get`, `sources`). Do not call
`GET /api/v1/search`, and do not reissue the PAT with `semantic:read`.

A grounded answer includes citations with `recordId` and `webUrl`. An `ask`
with **no citations** is not a retrieved fact, even if confidence is high.

If the CLI says it is not connected, have the agent run
`pipeshub auth connect-help` and follow that. Never paste a token into the
thread.

---

## Check that it worked

| Check | Expect |
| --- | --- |
| `pipeshub auth status --json` | Connected; your user and org; no token printed |
| `pipeshub search "a term you know is indexed" --json` | `hits` with `recordId` / `webUrl`, or exit `6` if nothing matches |
| `pipeshub ask "…" --json` | An answer **with citations**, or exit `6` if uncited |
| A document you cannot access | Denial — not a leak |

---

## If something fails

| Symptom | Cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agent says it needs `semantic:read` | It called `GET /api/v1/search` (history) instead of the CLI | New chat. Tell it to use `pipeshub ask` / `search`. Do not widen the PAT |
| `sources: []` and `ask` 401 with a `phpat_` token | PipesHub older than the prefix-forwarding fix | Upgrade PipesHub. Until then you can store the PAT without `phpat_`; put the prefix back after upgrade |
| `localhost` / connection refused from the agent | The sandbox is not on your machine | Use public HTTPS; put that origin in the keychain |
| `PIPESHUB_TOKEN` set, `PIPESHUB_BASE_URL` missing | `sandbox.env` does not reach Sprites | Second keychain entry (or org credential) for the URL |
| `pipeshub: command not found` | Stock Sprite image, no first-run install | `npm install -g @pipeshub-ai/mcp` once on that Sprite |
| `qm doctor` rejects a Resend *sending-only* key | [qm#353](https://github.com/yc-software/qm/issues/353) | Known false complaint; the key is the right kind |

## Do not

- Put a PAT in `sandbox.secretEnv` or in the prompt
- Mint `semantic:read` or `conversation:read` (unmintable on stock `MCP_SCOPES`)
- Point the sandbox at `http://localhost:…`
- Treat an uncited `ask` as grounded
- Expect `qm sandbox publish` to put `pipeshub` on PATH (Sprites)
